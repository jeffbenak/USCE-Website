           attending). We only accept a maximum of six medical professionals per rotation where there will be a rotating 
           assigned senior resident within the group.

              <p>
              We have three neurology packages- one is inclusive of the accommodation. You are free to decide where you 
              would like to stay. However, we strongly recommend that you stay close to the clinic in Park Ridge.

              <p>
              Some of our medical professionals can drive and go to four locations alone; however, finding parking in Chicago 
              can be stressful and expensive.

                and we cannot guarantee the same rotation schedule for group applicants.
                </p>

                <p>
                We also offer a structured, quality, result-driven rotation where we treat every medical professional as a part 
                of our family. We value your presence and do not discount your worth, thus our prices are reasonable.
