        <h2>BACKGROUND OF THE ROTATION</h2>
        <Col>
        <p>
           This is a hands-on neurology rotation for about 40-50 hours per week with a minimum of four weeks (up to 
           12 weeks depending on spot availability) where you get to closely work with your peers and Dr Calimag (the 
           attending). We only accept a maximum of six medical professionals per rotation where there will be a rotating 
           assigned senior resident within the group.

        </p>
        </Col>
            
        <p>

          This is an in-person rotation only and we do not provide any form of telerotations. You need to have a valid 
          US VISA to participate in the program or be a US Citizen.

        <p>

        There is a good combination of inpatient and outpatient experience where the medical professionals are 
        expected to improve their full circle clinical competencies at the end of the rotation.
