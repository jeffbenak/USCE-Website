     This is a hands-on neurology rotation for about 40-50 hours per week with a minimum of four weeks (up to 
     12 weeks depending on spot availability) where you get to closely work with your peers and Dr Calimag (the 
     attending). We only accept a maximum of six medical professionals per rotation where there will be a rotating

<h5>
HOW MUCH WILL THIS ROTATION COST?
</h5>

</div>

<div>

<div className='faqanswers'>

  <p>
  We offer three types of neurology packages, depending on your needs: assistance with accommodation, 
  transportation, interview sessions, personal statements, ERAS photos, etc.
  </p>

  

  <p>
  The price for the package starts at $2,299.

  </p>

  </div>

  <br></br>

  <h5>
  DO YOU PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN ACCOMMODATION? 
  </h5>

  <div className='faqanswers'>

  <p>
  We have three neurology packages- one is inclusive of the accommodation. You are free to decide where you 
  would like to stay. However, we strongly recommend that you stay close to the clinic in Park Ridge.
  </p>

  </div>

  <br></br>

  <h5>
  DO YOU PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION? 
  </h5>

  <div className='faqanswers'>

  <p>
  Chicago also has an established transportation system with trains and buses conveniently available. We offer 
  transportation privileges as well, inclusive of some of our packages.
  </p>

  

  <p>
  Some of our medical professionals can drive and go to four locations alone; however, finding parking in Chicago 
  can be stressful and expensive.
  </p>

  </div>

  <br></br>

  <h5>
  WILL THERE BE ROOM EXCLUSIVE FOR THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS? 
  </h5>

  <div className='faqanswers'>

  <p>
  The clinic in Park Ridge has a dedicated area for medical professionals to stay and leave their belongings. We 
  also have a room with snacks, water, drinks, and coffee, all free for everyone in practice.
  </p>

  </div>

  <h5>
  I DON'T HAVE A U.S. VISA. DO YOU PROVIDE US VISA SPONSORSHIP? 
  </h5>

  <div className='faqanswers'>

  <p>
  We unfortunately do not sponsor any form of US VISA. We can provide a letter of confirmation (VISA LETTER) 
  with your neurology rotation with Dr. Calimag as soon as we receive your essential requirements, verify the 
  availability of the slot for the rotation and process the non-refundable reservation fee of $500 for the neurology 
  package.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can present this letter to the US consulate on your application; however, we cannot guarantee your US 
  VISA application approval.
  </p>

  </div>

  <h5>
  DO YOU GIVE GROUP DISCOUNTS OR ANY DISCOUNTS? 
  </h5>

  <div className='faqanswers'>

    <p>
    Every applicant is carefully assessed based on our metrics for admission. Our spots are minimal and very limited, 
    and we cannot guarantee the same rotation schedule for group applicants.
    </p>

    <p>
    We also offer a structured, quality, result-driven rotation where we treat every medical professional as a part 
    of our family. We value your presence and do not discount your worth, thus our prices are reasonable.
